IBM Application Integration Suite on Cloud Demo

Description

The IBM Application Integration Suite on Cloud collateral builds upon the Hybrid Integration scenario of a typical multi-cloud and on-premise landscape as described in IBM Integration community article:

https://developer.ibm.com/integration/blog/2016/08/08/hybrid-integration-on-premises-to-multiple-clouds-going-beyond-the-whizz-bang-tool-demos/ 

This collateral refactors the hybrid integration scenario in the 

following way:
1.	The systems of record will remain on-premise.
2.	IIB on premise will be moved to IIB on Cloud
3.	IIB integration artefacts will remain largely unchanged. 
4.	API Connect will redirect the digital developers to the IIBoC end points.
5.	App Connect  will have a new “application” endpoint offered by IIBoC.
6.	Integration between the systems of record will continue unchanged.
7.	Systems of engagement running in Bluemix will continue to run unchanged.

This repository contains the "end state" collateral for the demo. An IBM Integration Community article can be viewed at the following URL @DA@ URL to come @DA@ that full explains the scenario and how it was built. The article will reference "key press by key press" instructional videos captured for every step of the build.

No programmers were harmed in the development of this collateral due to there being only one line of code written in building out of this Hybrid Integration use case.
